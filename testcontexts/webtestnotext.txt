You are given a scenario and you need to genenratora playwright test for it.
Do NOT generate test cose based on the scenerio alone.
Do run steps one by one using the tools provided by the playwright MCP.
Only after all steps are completed, emit a playwright JavaScript test that uses @playwright/test based on message history.
Save generated test file in the tests directory.
Execute the test file and iterate until the test passes.
